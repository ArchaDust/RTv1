# RTv1
Little raytracing project from 42/101, it is old and need some cleanup. Should compile on Mac easily. i'm going to port it to Windows and use SDL2 instead of MLX soon.

"libft/" contains most libc functions rewritten to 42/101's norm (part of the Libft project).<br/>
"minilibx_macos/" contains the graphic library MLX, created by Ol' in 2002 for Epitech.<br/>
"scenes/" contains basics scenes to play around.<br/>

Four simple form can be used: Sphere, Plane, Cylinder and Double Cones.<br/>
Any number of lights can be placed on a scene.

Future plans:<br/>
-port to Windows<br/>
-port to SDL2<br/>
-thread usage cleanup, it looks **horrible** right now<br/>
-optimizations<br/>
-specular lighting<br/>
