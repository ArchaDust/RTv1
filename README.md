# RTv1
Little raytracing project from 42/101, it is old and need some cleanup. Should compile on Mac easily. i'm going to port it to Windows and use SDL2 instead of MLX soon.

  "libft/" contains most libc functions rewritten to 42/101's norm (part of the Libft project).
  "minilibx_macos/" contains the graphic library MLX, created by Ol' in 2002 for Epitech.
  "scenes/" contains basics scenes to play around.

Four simple form can be used: Sphere, Plane, Cylinder and Double Cones
Any number of lights can be placed on a scene.
